  <h2 class="mt-5">Futureproofs is about the future</h2>
  <p class="lead summary">Climate-positive means more than planting trees.<br />
  Futureproofs doesn't just offset our carbon usage, we actively reduce it.<br />
  We don't just look at direct impact like server costs, but also office heating, staff travel and more.</p>

  <p class="summary">Futureproofs is about the future - the future of your business but also the future of the world we live in.</p>
  <p class="summary">Running our business in a way that respects and sustains the planet just makes sense. So, we've made a commitment to sustainability in everything we do across the organisation. This means not just Scope 1 emissions (those that arise directly from our activity), not just Scope 2 emissions (those that arise from energy we buy) but also Scope 3 emissions (everything else we do - business travel, employee commuting, goods and services we buy, and more).</p>
  <p class="summary">We've made a commitment to running our business, top to bottom, in a climate-positive way. This means looking at the choices we make (power for our servers, travel for our team, heating for our offices) and, one step at a time, making choices that are better for the climate. Scope 3 emissions, in particular, are complex and difficult to discover and deal with, so we over-estimate and over-invest in offsetting them.</p>
  <p class="summary">So, our commitment means making a financial investment in dealing with the harm we've done to the environment. As part of that, we started to work with <a href="https://ecologi.com/wearefutureproofsltd" target="_blank">Ecologi</a> in Spring 2021 to reduce and offset our carbon emissions. As a result, Futureproofs is climate-positive back to 2019, and we invest money every month in planting trees to restore lost ecosystems and in carbon offsetting to eliminate the damage our activities do to the environment. We also help and encourage our team to make better choices for their own lives, from travel to food to accommodation.</p>
