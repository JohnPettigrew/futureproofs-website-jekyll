    <h3>A message from our founder</h3>
    <div>I've worked for two decades in publishing as an editor and leader, and that's why I spent the past 6&nbsp;years making Futureproofs the best solution for managing book proofs online &ndash; especially for remote teams. I want to make editors' lives easier and better, and this has never been more needed than now, with the sudden huge disruption to our businesses from coronavirus.</div>
    <div>For teams used to dealing with physical paper proofs and having easy access to large-format printers and scanners, there have been huge challenges from the coronavirus crisis. But I believe Futureproofs can help you and your team to work more smoothly and effectively, especially at this time of change and uncertainty.</div>
    <div>As our industry turns its attention to rebuilding our teams and processes for the new situations in which we find ourselves, we want to help make it as easy as possible to adopt Futureproofs and get the benefits of remote, on-screen working during the proofing stages of book creation.</div>
    <h4 class="mb-1">The offer</h4>
    <div>We've made our software as easy to learn and use as possible, which is a big part of why <a href="#testimonials">our users love it</a>. But the hard part is often reviewing and updating workflows and processes to incorporate new tools. So, we'd like to offer you <strong>4&nbsp;days of free workflow consultancy (worth >£2500)</strong> when you take out any paid plan, to ensure that your adoption of Futureproofs is successful. We can use our decades of experience and knowledge of dozens of publishers to:
      <ul>
        <li>review your existing workflows;</li>
        <li>learn about the challenges you face;</li>
        <li>help you develop new processes; and</li>
        <li>train your staff.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>If you'd like to find out more, please check out the rest of this website and <a href="https://calendly.com/futureproofs/meeting" target="_blank">get in touch</a>. We'd be delighted to help you.</div>
