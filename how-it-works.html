          <p>These are times of unique pressure in publishing: to deliver books when teams have been driven out of offices to work at home; to update workflows and tools that may not have evolved significantly in decades; and to keep creating great
            books despite all this. That means there's an equivalent opportunity to do things the right way, the way that works with your team and your skills.</p>
          <p>Futureproofs is the first platform to focus on proofing as it's actually done by working editors and proofreaders. Futureproofs provides better workflow management, better team management, and better project management. And it can even
            reduce your carbon footprint, as a partner <a href="climate-positive.html">committed to being climate-positive</a> across our business!</p>
