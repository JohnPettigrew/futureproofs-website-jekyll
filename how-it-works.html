    <h2>Give your team the tools to deliver</h2>
    <h3>On-time publication, fewer mistakes, better reporting.</h3>

    <p>These are times of unique pressure in publishing: to update workflows and tools that may not have evolved significantly in decades. And this gives an equivalent opportunity: to do things the right way, the way that works with your team and
      your skills.</p>
    <p>Futureproofs is the first platform to focus on proofing as it's actually done by working editors and proofreaders. Futureproofs provides better workflow management, better team management, and better project management. And it can even reduce
      your carbon footprint, as a partner <a href="climate-positive.html">committed to being climate-positive</a> across our business!</p>
