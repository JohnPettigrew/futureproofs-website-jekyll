  <h2 class="pt-5">Clear, powerful, practical tools</h2>

  <p class="summary mt-5">The key issue today for many publishing businesses is efficiency - delivering more content, more quickly, more reliably and at lower cost. Thriving in the 21st Century means responding to these growing pressures, but existing workflows and tools have often not evolved in ways that really help editorial and production teams.</p>
  <p class="summary">Futureproofs is uniquely placed to resolve these tensions, as the first platform to focus on proofing as it's actually done by working editors and proofreaders. Futureproofs can successfully transform your processes by more closely linking editorial and production in new ways. Providing better tools to staff means that authors are happier and the whole business is more productive!</p>

      <h4 class="card-title">Spot proof issues before they become a problem</h4>
      <p class="card-text">Futureproofs makes sure you always know what's going on with your projects. Your dashboard shows up-to-the-minute statistics for every proof and member of the team - time spent working, corrections made, how many queries they're handling. This real-time data puts control in your hands. See who's done their work, whether the schedule is slipping, or if late changes are being made. Find out who made what change and when, and quickly detect whether work will be done on time so you can intervene. Control your budgets better with clear insight into supplier activity. Avoid expensive re-work and prevent changes being made too late in the process.</p>

      <h4 class="card-title">Roll out easily to your team</h4>
      <p class="card-text">Futureproofs lives in the cloud, which means no software to install or maintain. Even better, and unlike other PDF software, Futureproofs uses the established markup standards (BSI and Chicago) to minimise data entry and encourage precise, consistent markup. Just draw on the screen as you would on paper, and Futureproofs gives you the markup you need. Get comprehensive help, including guides to getting started and in-app support for all users. You'll also enjoy intelligent search and navigation tools, and dedicated review modes for different user roles. Work faster wherever you are to catch mistakes more easily. Futureproofs lets you work with text or artworks, in mono or colour, regardless of the page-layout software you use.</p>

      <h4 class="card-title">Work together securely</h4>
      <p class="card-text">Create project teams, communicate clearly and monitor their progress to manage the whole team effectively. Choose who can access your content and how much information each person can see, with role-based access controls. Enable project managers and editors to review their team's markup and quickly collate their input into a single master proof. Add and remove people from teams, change their roles and ensure people have the tools they need (with no confusing extras). Work from home or the office and pick up from the same point seamlessly - with your data always saved automatically to the cloud each time you make a change.</p>
