  <h3 class="col-12 col-md-9 col-lg-6 m-auto">Futureproofs supports on-time publication, reduces mistakes and lowers working capital.</h3>
  <h3 class="col-12 col-md-9 col-lg-6 ml-auto mr-auto mt-3">Futureproofs makes your Board happy, your team happy, your authors happy and your customers happy.</h3>

  <p class="summary mt-4">We all need to keep becoming more efficient &ndash; to deliver more content, more quickly, more reliably and at lower cost. This means having to update workflows and tools that may not have evolved significantly in decades.</p>
  <p class="summary">Futureproofs is uniquely placed to resolve these tensions. We are the first platform to focus on proofing as it's actually done by working editors and proofreaders. Futureproofs can successfully transform your processes by more closely linking editorial and production. And providing better tools to staff means that authors are happier and the whole business is more productive!</p>

      <p class="card-text">Futureproofs makes sure your team always know what's going on with their projects. Personalised dashboards show up-to-the-minute statistics for every proof and member of the team &ndash; time spent working, corrections made, how many queries they're handling.</p>
      <p class="card-text">This real-time data puts control in your hands. See who's done their work early, whether the schedule is slipping, or if late changes are being made. Find out who made which change and when, and quickly detect whether work will be complete on time so you can intervene. Control your budgets better with clear insight into supplier activity.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Futureproofs lives in the cloud, which means there's no software to install or maintain. Even better, and unlike other PDF software, Futureproofs uses the established markup standards (BSI and Chicago) to minimise data entry and encourage precise, consistent markup. Just draw on the screen as you would on paper, and Futureproofs gives you the markup you need.</p>
      <p class="card-text">Get comprehensive help, including face-to-face or video training sessions, comprehensive documentation and in-app chat support for all users. You'll also enjoy intelligent search and navigation tools, and dedicated modes for different user roles. Work with text or artworks, in mono or colour, regardless of the page-layout software you use.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Create project teams, communicate clearly and monitor their progress to manage the whole team effectively. Choose who can access your content with role-based access control. Enable project managers and editors to review their team's markup and quickly collate their input into a single master proof. Ensure each person has the tools they need, with no confusing extras. Support your team as they work from home or the office - with their data always saved automatically to the cloud each time they make a change.</p>
