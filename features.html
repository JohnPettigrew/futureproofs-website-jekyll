  <h3 class="col-12 col-md-9 col-lg-6 m-auto">On-time publication, fewer mistakes, better reporting.</h3>

  <p class="summary mt-4">These are times of unique pressure in publishing: to update workflows and tools that may not have evolved significantly in decades. And this gives an equivalent opportunity: to do things the right way, the way that works with your team and your skills.</p>
  <p class="summary">Futureproofs is the first platform to focus on proofing as it's actually done by working editors and proofreaders. Futureproofs provides better workflow management, better team management, and better project management. And it can even reduce your carbon footprint, as a partner <a href="climate-positive.html">committed to being climate-positive</a> across our business!</p>
