  <p class="summary mt-5">The key issue today for many publishing executives is the efficiency of their businesses. Surviving and thriving in the 21st Century means responding to the growing pressures of the new marketplace &ndash; especially the continually rising costs of production and the demands for higher and higher discounts from retailers. And that's in addition to the usual uncertainty of doing business in a highly competitive and mature market!</p>
  <p class="summary">Futureproofs is uniquely placed to improve the efficiency, resilience and performance of a critical area of the production process that has remained unchanged for decades. Futureproofs is the first company to focus on this critical area of activity and successfully transform business processes by more closely linking editorial and production in new ways. Providing better tools to staff means that authors are happier and the whole business is more productive.</p>

      <h4 class="card-title">Built from experience</h4>
      <p class="card-text">Our Founder and CEO, <strong>John Pettigrew</strong>, set out to create Futureproofs in 2013 because of his long experience in publishing. Starting as a desk editor in the mid-90s, John has experienced and managed publishing teams in a range of environments, and the <strong>pressure to deliver</strong> was the same everywhere.</p>
      <p class="card-text">However, the tools his teams were being asked to use were in many cases still grounded in the 1980s, with huge amounts of paper often being physically shipped around. Even where digital alternatives were in use, they were crude facsimiles of the physical workflow rather than <strong>a genuine digital rethink</strong> of the work that was being done.</p>
      <p class="card-text">No other company does this. And I'll show you how we can help when we meet.</p>
