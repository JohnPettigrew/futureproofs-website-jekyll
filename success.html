    <h3>Futureproofs helps your team deliver to market on time more easily, reliably and cheaply – save up to 25% on your proofs!.</h3>

    <p>Improving your processes means that you make a real difference. Using Futureproofs is no different – we want your team to become more efficient, save money and be happier! Which means that we want to help you measure that difference.</p>
    <p>It can feel difficult to deal with business metrics (as they're called) but it can be as simple as comparing the date from your approval paperwork with the actual date your team delivered. Ideally, they'd be the same but sometimes things slip.</p>
    <p>But beware - metrics can be slippery! Just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean that it's the right thing to measure. For example, you might be tempted to measure the success of a website by number of visitors, but this is a so-called 'vanity metric' because it can only ever go up. You need numbers that reflect real current performance.</p>
