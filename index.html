  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-1">Build a better book workflow</h2>
  <h3>More efficient editorial and production <br class="d-none d-sm-block" />with better management and accurate records</h3>
  <p class="summary">Publishers have spent decades building processes for physical books using physical proofs. Now, we're asked to go on-screen in only months &ndash; or even weeks or days! For teams used to dealing with paper proofs, or having easy access to large-format printers and scanners, this is no easy task.</p>
  <p class="summary">Fortunately, Futureproofs provides an answer. Based on decades of practical editorial and production experience, Futureproofs solves the day-to-day problems of on-screen proof checking for editors, proofreaders and authors. By understanding deeply why they work the way they do, we've built software that really does help them work faster and better &ndash; while also helping their managers maintain a close view of how the team is performing, without requiring constant meetings or emails.</p>
  <p class="summary">Whether they're in a team of 2 or 200, our users say their work 'takes a fraction of the time' with 'frankly gorgeous' tools. Your team may sit at neighbouring desks or even opposite sides of the globe: either way, Futureproofs provides the tools and training for them to deliver!</p>

      <h4 class="card-title">Publish faster</h4>
      <p class="card-text last">Your team will spend less time on their proofs, less time chasing progress, less time reading emails and less time worrying about different versions of the project. Markup in Futureproofs is <strong>up to 25% faster</strong> than other PDF software, while creating master proofs and comparing different versions are <strong>up to 50% faster</strong> than working on paper. And markup in Futureproofs is always clear and consistent!</p>
