    <h5 class="mb-3">A message from our founder</h5>
    <div>I've spent the past 6 years creating Futureproofs as the solution for managing book proofs online, and especially for remote teams. And I did it because I want to make editors' lives easier and better. This has never been more needed than now, with the sudden huge disruption to our lives from coronavirus.</div>
    <div>For teams used to dealing with physical paper proofs, or to having easy access to company servers, printers and scanners, or just to being able to ask questions of other team members, the change to enforced home working is huge. But I believe Futureproofs can help make the proofing process go more smoothly for your team, especially at this time of change and uncertainty.</div>
    <div>So, I've taken the decision to make Futureproofs available <em>for free</em> to new customers who are dealing with significant disruption to their teams from this emergency. Until the end of June, we'll give you training, support and full access to the Futureproofs platform without charge, so your team can keep on making those fantastic books.</div>
    <div>If you'd like to find out more, please check out the rest of this website and <a href="https://calendly.com/futureproofs/meeting" target="_blank">get in touch</a>. We'd be delighted to help you.</div>
