        <p>Choose to pay annually (for a discount!) or monthly. Use the price calculator by selecting the average number of pages you publish each month, and see how little Futureproofs would cost you. From 500 to 3000 pages a month on our Pro plan (contact us if you need more pages or integrations with your other systems).</p>
        <p>We use the average publication rate because we know that everyone's volume goes up and down during the year, and paying at the peak level would be unfair!<br />To find out more, <a href="#faqs">see the FAQs below</a>.</p>

            Your subscription is based on your publishing volume &ndash; the number of pages you publish, not the number of proofs you upload. Each plan includes a monthly allowance that you can upload against (much like a mobile-phone plan). If you
            don't use your page allowance, it will roll over to the next month (and the next, and the next&hellip;).<br /><br />
            For example, if you pay for 500 pages of new content each month, this would let you work on two new 192-page books every month. The 'spare' 108 pages remain available for 3 months (if you pay monthly) or a year (if you pay annually). That
            way, you're covered when you have a busy month &ndash; which we all know happen regularly!

            We strongly recommend that all software deployments include an appropriate emphasis on training the teams beforehand. Although Futureproofs is designed to be easy to use, all change needs suitable support and guidance. If you are a larger
            organisation, this is even more important, and we may include additional training in our quotes after consultation with you and your team.

            For monthly subscription plans, we take payment monthly by credit card or direct debit/ACH. For annual plans, we also accept payment by direct transfer to our bank account (details supplied on invoice). We do not accept payment by

            We send an invoice (including VAT where appropriate) before we take payment in all cases, for your records.

            If you have some pages left at the end of the month, they will roll over and be added to your total the following month. So, if you are on the Intro plan and have 30 pages left at the end of a month (i.e. you only used 170 pages), then
            you will have 230 pages at the start of the following month. Unused pages roll over for 3 months (if you are paying monthly) or 12 months (if you are paying annually).

            If you're using Futureproofs more than you expected, you can easily upgrade at any point. However, we won't just cut you off. All our plans are based on your average usage, not your peak, so if you have a busy month then that's fine with
            us. And, if you do go over your allowance unexpectedly, just let us know and we'll sort you out!

            When your subscription ends, you continue to have access to existing projects and proofs. However, you will lose two key things: any surplus pages you've built up over the course of your subscription; and the ability to upload new proofs
            to your projects.<br /><br />
            However, you and your team <i>can</i> continue to work on any proofs that have already been uploaded to the site. This means adding new markup, continuing conversations in queries, collating master proofs and reviewing them in designer
            mode.
