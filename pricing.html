  <h2>Pay for only what you need</h2>
  <p class="col-12 col-md-9 col-lg-6 m-auto summary">Run a pilot with our Intro plan: all the tools you need to see how Futureproofs can work for you. Like all our plans, it covers as many people as you need, and includes the training and support you need to get started.</p>

          Your subscription is based on your publishing volume &ndash; the number of pages you publish, not the number of proofs you upload. Each plan includes a monthly allowance that you can upload against (much like a mobile-phone plan). If you don't use your page allowance, it will roll over to the next month (and the next, and the next&hellip;).<br /><br />
          For example, if you pay for 500 pages of new content each month, this would let you work on two new 192-page books every month. The 'spare' 108 pages remain available for 3 months (if you pay monthly) or a year (if you pay annually). That way, you're covered when you have a busy month &ndash; which we all know happen regularly!

          All our subscription plans include hands-on training, which we can deliver in person or by video. <strong>(At present, during the coronavirus restrictions, all training is by video only.)</strong> If you have a large team, we can provide additional or custom training sessions, as well as training-the-trainers and in-house programme development.<br /><br />
          We strongly recommend that all software deployments include an appropriate emphasis on training the teams beforehand. Although Futureproofs is designed to be easy to use, all change needs suitable support and guidance. If you are a larger organisation, this is even more important, and we may include additional training in our quotes after consultation with you and your team.

          We send an invoice (including VAT where appropriate) before we take payment in all cases, for your records.

          If you have some pages left at the end of the month, they will roll over and be added to your total the following month. So, if you are on the Intro plan and have 30 pages left at the end of a month (i.e. you only used 170 pages), then you will have 230 pages at the start of the following month. Unused pages roll over for 3 months (if you are paying monthly) or 12 months (if you are paying annually).

          If you're using Futureproofs more than you expected, you can easily upgrade at any point. However, we won't just cut you off. All our plans are based on your average usage, not your peak, so if you have a busy month then that's fine with us. And, if you do go over your allowance unexpectedly, just let us know and we'll sort you out!

          You will receive an invoice every month (including VAT where appropriate) and your payment will be taken automatically by your chosen method (direct debit or credit card). If we don't receive payment within 30 days of our invoice, you may lose access to the Futureproofs service, so we recommend making sure your credit card or direct debit information are correct at all times.

          When your subscription ends, you continue to have access to existing projects and proofs. However, you will lose two key things: any surplus pages you've built up over the course of your subscription; and the ability to upload new proofs to your projects.<br /><br />
          However, you and your team <i>can</i> continue to work on any proofs that have already been uploaded to the site. This means adding new markup, continuing conversations in queries, collating master proofs and reviewing them in designer mode.
